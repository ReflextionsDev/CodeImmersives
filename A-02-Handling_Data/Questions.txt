Explain what the ".map" properties of arrays does.

.map iterates through every element of an array and performs defined logic before returning it as a new array

Explain what the ".reduce" properties of arrays does.

.reduce iterates through every element of an array and reduces it to a single value via an accumulator value

How is ".map" different from reduce?

.map does not carry over an accumulator value between iterations

What are "switch" statements?

Switch statements are similar to if / else if / else but immediatly jump to the matching case rather than running through the statement linerally. The default case performs as an else or a catch all condition.
