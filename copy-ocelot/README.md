# Copy Ocelot

For this assignment, we'll be recreating a more complex website than anything we've tried so far. Any CSS is on the table (flex, grid, etc.) so it's up to you how you want to build this.

## Instructions

Start of by choosing one of the following websites to copy:

### [Weather.com](https://weather.com/)

The whole thing!

### [Anthony's Profile on Populi](https://dfa.populiweb.com/router/contacts/people/23356688)

The whole thing!

### [The GitHub Repository for the Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)

The whole thing!

### [This Question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/348170/how-do-i-undo-git-add-before-commit)

The whole thing except you only have to include one of the many answers to the question in your recreation. You can also ignore the right sidebar (the yellow section and content below it).

### A Wildcard??

You can also choose a different site sith similar complexity to the four options listed. If you choose to do this, just run it by Mesi or Alex first.

## Tips

* It's okay if it isn't 100% perfect!
* To get started, try taking a screenshot of the page and drawing boxes on it to create a plan for how you'll structure your HTML
* In the browser, use `[CMD][SHIFT][c]` to open the developer tools and inspect your target website

## Stretch Goals

* Add various [CSS transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) for when you hover over various elements on your page. It's okay if these deviate from the original page in question, go wild!
* Try restarting and recreating another page!
