# Holy Media Queries, Batman! - Flexbox

### Introduction

Now we'll be using CSS Flexbox to change a holy grail layout into a _responsive_ holy grail layout. You should be able to complete this using ONLY the CSS file, but... use whatever tools you like. As long as one of those tools is media queries! 


### Scared By Flexbox?

You shouldn't be! You are, after all, a little more familiar with it. But if you'd rather, you can always switch to [the Grid version of this challenge](https://github.com/ci-wdi-900/holy-media-queries-batman-grid).


### Setup

This is a fork-and-clone situation. Go do that thing!


### Basics

You have as resources:

1. A holy grail layout. Your desktop layout is done!
2. Screenshots in `assets` for a tablet layout and a mobile layout. Check them out!


### Your Goal

It doesn't have to be _pixel-perfect_, but implement the following two layouts:

1. A mobile layout that takes effect if the screen is below 700 pixes wide.
2. A tablet layout that takes effect if the screen is bigger than the mobile layout but below 1100 pixels wide.

Remember: The goal here is to practice your media queries and Flexbox, **NOT** to work on your pixel-perfect heights and widths!


### Good Luck!

But Batman doesn't need _luck_.
